Rust Learning Journey
=====================

**Welcome** to my Rust Learning Journey! This repository documents my progress as I explore and learn the Rust programming language. During my first semester pursuing a degree in cybersecurity, I discovered a passion for programming through an Intro to Programming course in Python â€” the only programming course offered by my school. As I am nearing the end of my degree path, I am choosing to revisit my newfound enjoyment of programming with a language known for its focus on safety and security: Rust.

### About Rust

Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. It's known for its high performance and memory safety features.

### Objectives

*   Understand the basic syntax and concepts of Rust.
*   Develop small projects and utilities as I learn.
*   Explore advanced Rust features like ownership, lifetimes, and concurrency.
*   Document my learnings and challenges faced during this journey.

### Learning Resources

*   [The Rust Programming Language Book (Brown University Experiment - version)](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/)
*   [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html)
*   [Rustlings - Small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/)
